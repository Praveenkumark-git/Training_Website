Super in-depth, with great challenges and projects that will solidify your Javascript understanding. I found the lectures were paced perfectly -- Jonas doesn't skip over anything that might be useful to a JS developer\"</em> â€” Carson Bartholomew</p><p><br></p><p>JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world. It powers the entire modern web. It provides millions of high-paying jobs all over the world.</p><p>That's why you want to learn JavaScript too. And you came to the right place!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why is this the right JavaScript course for you?</strong></p><p><em>This is the most complete JavaScript course on Udemy. It's an all-in-one package that will take you from the very fundamentals of JavaScript, all the way to building modern and complex applications.</em></p><p>You will learn modern JavaScript from the very beginning, step-by-step. I will guide you through <strong>practical and fun code examples</strong>, <strong>important theory</strong> about how JavaScript works behind the scenes, and <strong>beautiful and complete projects</strong>.</p><p>You will also learn how to think like a developer, how to plan application features, how to architect your code, how to debug code, and a lot of other real-world skills that you will need on your developer job.</p><p>And unlike other courses, this one actually contains beginner, intermediate, advanced, and even expert topics, so <strong>you don't have to buy any other course in order to master JavaScript</strong> from the ground up!</p><p>But... You don't have to go into all these topics. This is a huge course, because, after all, it's \"The Complete JavaScript Course\". In fact, it's like many courses in one! <strong>But you can become an excellent developer by watching only parts of the course</strong>. That's why I built this course in a very modular way, and designed pathways that will take you through the course faster.</p><p><em>By the end of the course, you will have the knowledge and confidence that you need in order to ace your job interviews and become a professional developer.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why am I the right JavaScript teacher for you?</strong></p><p>My name is Jonas, I'm an experienced web developer and designer, and one of Udemy's top instructors. I have been teaching this bestselling course since 2016 to over 350,000 developers, always listening to feedback and understanding exactly how students actually learn.</p><p>Recently, I took all my teaching experience to build this new and greatly improved JavaScript course. It's now the best and most in-depth JavaScript course that you will find on Udemy (and maybe the entire internet).</p><p>I know how students learn JavaScript and what they need in order to master it. And with that knowledge, I designed the ideal course curriculum. <strong>It's a unique blend of real-world projects, deep explanations, theory lectures, and challenges</strong>, that will take you from zero to an expert and confident JavaScript developer in just a couple of weeks.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>So what exactly is covered in the course?</strong></p><ul><li><p>Build 5 beautiful real-world projects for your portfolio! In these projects, you will learn how to plan and architect your applications using flowcharts and common JavaScript patterns</p></li><li><p>Master the JavaScript fundamentals: variables, if/else, operators, boolean logic, functions, arrays, objects, loops, strings, and more</p></li><li><p>Learn modern JavaScript (ES6+) from the beginning: arrow functions, destructuring, spread operator, default arguments, optional chaining (ES2020), and more</p></li><li><p>How JavaScript works behind the scenes: engines, the call stack, hoisting, scoping, the 'this' keyword, reference values, and more.</p></li><li><p>Deep dive into functions: arrow functions, first-class and higher-order functions, bind, and closures.</p></li><li><p>Deep dive into object-oriented programming: prototypal inheritance, constructor functions (ES5), classes (ES6), encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. [This is like a small standalone course]</p></li><li><p>Deep dive into asynchronous JavaScript: the event loop, promises, async/await, and error handling. You will use these to access data from third-party APIs with AJAX calls. [This is like a small standalone course]</p></li><li><p>Learn modern tools that are used by professional web developers: NPM, Parcel (module bundler), Babel, and ES6 modules</p></li></ul><p>Check out the course curriculum for an even more detailed overview of the content :)</p><p><br></p><p><strong>This is what's also included in the package:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Up-to-date HD-quality videos, that are easy to search and reference (great for Udemy for Business students)</p></li><li><p>Videos are also downloadable. Learn wherever you want, even without an internet connection!</p></li><li><p>Professional English captions (not the&nbsp;auto-generated ones)</p></li><li><p>Downloadable starter code and final code for each section</p></li><li><p>Downloadable slides for 40+ theory videos (not boring, I promise!)</p></li><li><p>Free support in the course Q&amp;A</p></li><li><p>25+ coding challenges and 25+ assignments to practice your new skills (solutions included)</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>This course is for you if...</strong></p><ul><li><p>... you want to gain a true and deep understanding of JavaScript</p></li><li><p>... you have been trying to learn JavaScript but: 1) still don't really understand JavaScript, or 2) still don't feel confident to code real apps</p></li><li><p>... you are interested in using a library/framework like React, Angular, Vue, or Node.js in the future</p></li><li><p>... you already know JavaScript and are looking for an advanced course.
